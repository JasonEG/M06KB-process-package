# Narrated Walkthrough Outline — Grade Finalization in PowerSchool

**Target length:** 1:45–2:00
**Audience:** Teachers finalizing quarter or semester grades
**Tone:** Calm, direct, encouraging — assume the viewer is doing this under a deadline

## [0:00–0:15] Hook — Why This Matters

> "At the end of every quarter and semester, every teacher has one critical job in PowerSchool: store final grades before the window closes. A missed step here doesn't just affect your gradebook — it can cascade into transcript errors that take weeks to unwind. This walkthrough shows you exactly what to do, in order, so you can get it done right the first time."

**On screen:** Title card — "Grade Finalization in PowerSchool"

## [0:15–0:30] When to Start

> "You'll know it's time when you get an email from your principal or secretary saying the grading window is open — or when you notice the end of a quarter or semester is approaching. Either way, don't wait. Log in as soon as you're ready."

**On screen:** Example principal notification email (blurred/redacted)

## [0:30–1:00] The Main Steps

> "Here's the process at a glance — we'll go step by step.
>
> First, log in to PowerSchool and open PowerTeacher Pro under one of your classes.
>
> Next — and this is required — go to Grading, then Score Sheet, and review every grade for every class. Correct anything that looks wrong before you move on.
>
> Then verify your grade weights. Go to Settings, Traditional Grade Calculations, and for each class confirm the quarter exam is set to 10% and the rest adds up to 90%. Save before you exit — every time.
>
> After weights are confirmed, go to Grading, Grades, Traditional to view the calculated final grade. If it looks right, you're ready to mark it complete."

**On screen:** Screen recording stepping through Score Sheet → Traditional Grade Calculations → Final Grade view

## [1:00–1:25] Marking Complete and Notifying

> "To mark a class complete, scroll to the bottom of the screen to Final Grade Status and check the box that says 'Semester or Quarter Final Grades Are Complete.' Save. Then use the drop-down at the top to switch to your next class and repeat.
>
> Once every class is marked complete, send a quick email to the secretary confirming that all grades are stored in PowerSchool. That email is your paper trail — don't skip it. Then log out."

**On screen:** Final Grade Status checkbox → Save → email draft

## [1:25–1:45] Where People Get Stuck

> "Three places trip people up most often.
>
> One: a grade is missing or wrong in the Score Sheet. Fix it there before continuing — don't mark anything complete with a bad grade underneath it.
>
> Two: grade weights won't save. If that happens, reopen Traditional Grade Calculations and try again. If it still won't save, that's a call to IT.
>
> Three: the Final Grade Status checkbox won't let you check it. First make sure you have the correct grading period selected in the drop-down at the top of the screen. That fixes it most of the time."

**On screen:** Annotated screenshots of each failure point

## [1:45–2:00] Where to Get Help

> "If you're stuck and can't move forward on your own, two resources will help you.
>
> The Knowledge Base article has the full explanation of every step — that's in the docs folder of this package.
>
> And if it's a system issue, submit a ticket through the IT Help Desk portal — the link is in the Quick Reference Guide.
>
> You've got this. Follow the steps, save often, and send that email when you're done."
