## Steps

> For the full procedure with screenshots and decision points, see [the full Standard Operating Procedure](./SOP_v1.md).

1. **Confirm it's time.** Check for a principal/secretary email or recognize the grading period is ending. If it is not yet time, stop — no action needed.

2. **Log in to PowerSchool** using your username and password.

3. **Open PowerTeacher Pro** by selecting it under one of your currently taught classes.

4. **Verify grades.** Go to **Grading → Score Sheet**. Use the class drop-down to cycle through all your classes and review each grade line by line. Correct any errors before continuing.

5. **Verify grade weights.** Go to **Settings → Traditional Grade Calculations**. Select a class, then choose **Actions → Edit**. Confirm weights are set correctly (quarter exam = 10%; remaining 90% split across other assignments or categories). Save before exiting.

6. **Repeat Step 5 for every class** you teach.

7. **Review the final grade.** Go to **Grading → Grades → Traditional** to view the calculated final grade for the class. If the grade is incorrect, return to Step 4.

8. **Mark grades complete.** Scroll to **Final Grade Status** at the bottom of the screen and check **"Semester or Quarter Final Grades Are Complete."** An optional comment may be entered. **Save before exiting.**

9. **Repeat for all classes** using the grading period menu at the top of the screen. If all classes are finalized → proceed to Step 10. If not → return to Step 7.

10. **Notify the secretary.** Send an email confirming all grades are stored in PowerSchool, then log out.

## Troubleshooting

| Problem | What to Do | Escalate If… |
|---------|------------|--------------|
| **Grades are missing or incorrect** | Correct grades in the Score Sheet; re-verify before continuing | Assignment is missing — contact student or mark a zero |
| **Grade weights are wrong** | Reopen Traditional Grade Calculations; adjust and save | You cannot get weights to save — contact IT support |
| **Final Grade Status won't mark complete** | Return to Final Grade Status screen; check the completion box and save | Still blocked after verifying the correct grading period is selected — contact IT support |
