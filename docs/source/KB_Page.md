# How to Finalize Grades in PowerSchool

---

## Summary

This process walks teachers through the steps to verify, finalize, and submit grades in PowerSchool at the end of a quarter or semester.

- Start when you receive a grading reminder from the principal or secretary, or when you recognize the grade finalization period is ending.
- Verify that all grades are accurate in PowerSchool.
- Confirm grade weights are set correctly and mark each class as complete.
- Email the secretary to confirm all grades are stored.

---

## When to Use

Use this process when:

- You receive an email from the **principal or secretary** indicating that the grade finalization period has started, **or**
- You recognize that the **end of a quarter or semester is approaching**

Do **not** use this process to enter individual assignment grades — that happens before this process begins.

## Steps

> For the full procedure with screenshots and decision points, see [the full Standard Operating Procedure](./SOP_v1.md).

1. **Confirm it's time.** Check for a principal/secretary email or recognize the grading period is ending. If it is not yet time, stop — no action needed.

2. **Log in to PowerSchool** using your username and password.

3. **Open PowerTeacher Pro** by selecting it under one of your currently taught classes.

4. **Verify grades.** Go to **Grading → Score Sheet**. Use the class drop-down to cycle through all your classes and review each grade line by line. Correct any errors before continuing.

5. **Verify grade weights.** Go to **Settings → Traditional Grade Calculations**. Select a class, then choose **Actions → Edit**. Confirm weights are set correctly (quarter exam = 10%; remaining 90% split across other assignments or categories). Save before exiting.

6. **Repeat Step 5 for every class** you teach.

7. **Review the final grade.** Go to **Grading → Grades → Traditional** to view the calculated final grade for the class. If the grade is incorrect, return to Step 4.

8. **Mark grades complete.** Scroll to **Final Grade Status** at the bottom of the screen and check **"Semester or Quarter Final Grades Are Complete."** An optional comment may be entered. **Save before exiting.**

9. **Repeat for all classes** using the grading period menu at the top of the screen. If all classes are finalized → proceed to Step 10. If not → return to Step 7.

10. **Notify the secretary.** Send an email confirming all grades are stored in PowerSchool, then log out.

## Troubleshooting

| Problem | What to Do | Escalate If… |
|---------|------------|--------------|
| **Grades are missing or incorrect** | Correct grades in the Score Sheet; re-verify before continuing | Assignment is missing — contact student or mark a zero |
| **Grade weights are wrong** | Reopen Traditional Grade Calculations; adjust and save | You cannot get weights to save — contact IT support |
| **Final Grade Status won't mark complete** | Return to Final Grade Status screen; check the completion box and save | Still blocked after verifying the correct grading period is selected — contact IT support |

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: What if I haven't received an email from the principal or secretary — should I still finalize grades?**
A: Yes, if you know the grading period is ending, you do not need to wait for a reminder. Check your school calendar and proceed when appropriate.

**Q: Do I need to finalize grades for every class I teach?**
A: Yes. Steps 5–9 must be completed for each class individually. Use the class drop-down and grading period menu to cycle through all of them.

**Q: What's the difference between a quarter and a semester finalization?**
A: The steps are the same — the only difference is which grading period you select in the menu at the top of the screen. Make sure you select the correct period before marking grades complete.

**Q: What if I marked grades complete but need to make a correction?**
A: Uncheck the "Semester or Quarter Final Grades Are Complete" box, make your correction in the Score Sheet, re-verify the final grade, then re-check the completion box and save. Notify the secretary if the window has already closed.

**Q: Who do I contact if I can't log in to PowerSchool?**
A: Contact the IT Help Desk via the [IT Help Desk Portal](https://ww3.autotask.net/ClientPortal/login.aspx?ci=302139&accountId=431).
