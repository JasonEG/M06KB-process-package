2. **Log in** — [ps-co.metasolutions.net](https://ps-co.metasolutions.net)

3. **Open PowerTeacher Pro** — select it under a currently taught class

   → Grade incorrect? **Correct it before continuing.**

5. **`[REQUIRED]` Verify grade weights** *(repeat per class)* — Settings → Traditional Grade Calculations → Actions → Edit
   Confirm: exam = **10%**, other = **90%**. **Save before exiting.**

6. **Review final grade** — Grading → Grades → Traditional
   → Grade incorrect? **Return to Step 4.**
   → Grade correct? **Proceed.**

7. **`[REQUIRED]` Mark grades complete** *(repeat per class)* — Final Grade Status (bottom of screen) → check **"Semester or Quarter Final Grades Are Complete"** → Save
   → All classes done? **Proceed.**
   → Not all done? **Return to Step 6.**

8. **Notify secretary & log out** — Email confirming all grades are stored in PowerSchool → log out
