## Steps

1. **Confirm timing** — If principal/secretary email received OR end of grading period is near → proceed. If not → stop.
2. **Log in** — [ps-co.metasolutions.net](https://ps-co.metasolutions.net)
3. **Open PowerTeacher Pro** — select it under a currently taught class
4. **`[REQUIRED]` Verify grades** — Grading → Score Sheet → review all classes line by line. If incorrect → correct before continuing.
5. **`[REQUIRED]` Verify grade weights** *(repeat per class)* — Settings → Traditional Grade Calculations → Actions → Edit. Confirm: exam = **10%**, other = **90%**. **Save before exiting.**
6. **Review final grade** — Grading → Grades → Traditional. If incorrect → return to Step 4. If correct → proceed.
7. **`[REQUIRED]` Mark grades complete** *(repeat per class)* — Final Grade Status (bottom of screen) → check **"Semester or Quarter Final Grades Are Complete"** → Save. If all classes done → proceed. If not → return to Step 6.
8. **Notify secretary & log out** — Email confirming all grades are stored in PowerSchool → log out.
